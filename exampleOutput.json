A lot effort is currently happening to make Splinter production-ready. Splinter has a published roadmap -- https://www.splinter.dev/community/planning/roadmap.html. Since my team is involved in multiple initiatives (Sawtooth, Splinter, Grid, Transact), we tend to focus on one area for any given Sprint. The last effort for Sawtooth was replacing  Sawtooth's transaction handling with Transact. The next push will be replacing consensus with a consensus library. The push after that will be making Sawtooth into a Splinter service. And after that, it will be about defining what is left for a Sawtooth 2 release. We are also at the same time working on replacing the CLI with a pure Rust CLI and turning Sawtooth into a library (sawtooth-lib). As far as publishing a roadmap, etc. - we are also a branch to update the website, and after that is complete we will likely add a roadmap page.",
